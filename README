Pollenizer Facebook test (v.0.1)
================================

This is a demonstration of loading images from Flickr using their API and showing them on the page 5 at a time.

The code is build using:
- JQuery
- PHP
- CSS
- PHP Fat Free Framework (http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/)

Caching is handled within the framework and so does not require any long term MySQL backend.


Unit testing
------------

Due to a glitch in my machine, I've not had time to get phpunit installed correctly and run the tests, but have written the core unit test for:
- Keyword exists
- Keyword passed valiation
- Page number is numeric
- Page number exists
- Search function returns a result
